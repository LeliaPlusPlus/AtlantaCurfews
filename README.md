# AtlantaCurfews
This data set provides information on dates, curfew times, and when Atlanta sends out curfews in the wake of civil unrest around the world following the COVID-19 pandemic, economic collapse, and oppression of Black, Brown, and poor people. The motivation for this data set is the outrage at curfew notifications being sent after or shortly before the curfew times. In some cases, protestors are not able to receive these notifications as they "black out" (by turning off their cell phone) in order to avoid surveillance by the state. 

On May 30, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued a curfew for the city of Atlanta from Saturday, May 30 to Sunday, June 7 amidst civil unrest across the nation. The same day Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued an executive order for the deployment of about 3,000 National Guards. On Saturday, June 6, the curfew set at 8 PM EST was lifted after the 9th day of protests. 

This is an open source data set. Please feel free to send questions, comments, concerns, and mistakes to lelia@mit.edu.
